# Khan Academy Gallery
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS+Handlebars</strong>

Iâ€™m applying to Khan Academy soon, and I thought they might enjoy seeing all the scope creep I added to my projects for their JS class last year. 

As you can see I took a lot of CSS from the [Projects section on my homepage](http://dargacode.com/#projects). 

I also used this as a chance to try using front-end templating (via [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/)). Compared to my porfolio page, where I created every Project and Skill element through manual DOM manipulation, using a template was much faster and much less brittle. I did have to include a 64KB JS file, but the tradeoff seems worth it to me. 

Speaking of download size and performance, I also removed the entire Font Awesome library and replaced it with a small custom font generated with [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/), which only includes 3 icons. This reduced my download size by several hundred KB.
